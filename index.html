            <p>
              Hi! I am a graduate student at Portland State University. I used
              to be a software engineer for four years before starting my
              Master's program here. I primarily worked in the development of
              Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality applications.
            </p>
            <p>
              My area of specialisation was creating User Interface for the
              VR/AR apps and my tech stack was initially C++ with Qt and Open
              Scene Graph (based on OpenGL), and later Unreal Engine.
            </p>
            <p>
              My projects are an open source notepad clone and a machine
              learning application which predicts the real estate prices based
              on existing data of a particular location, using gradient descent
              algorithm.
            </p>
            <p>
              I am also very interested in UI development for web applications
              which is why I am exploring web development, particularly its
              frontend and UI aspects.

                    Kommadek is a GUI (Graphical User Interface) application for
                    reading CSV (Comma Separated Values) files. It allows the
                    user to select a CSV file from the local file system and
                    then display it in a tabular format. It also allows the user
                    to edit the contents of the CSV file and either overwrite
                    the changes or save it as a separate file. It is a
                    cross-platform application and can be used in macOS, Windows
                    and Linux.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The primary reason for building the project was that I was
                    looking for a clean and minimal CSV reader which could
                    display the contents of a CSV file in a tabular format when
                    I was working in my previous company where I often had to
                    work with CSV files in the project I was assigned to. Many
                    such applications were available, but unfortunately most of
                    them were shareware or adware or freemium software. I wanted
                    at least a freeware application, if not open source.
                    Unfortunately I could not find any such application for
                    macOS so I wanted to make one myself instead, but I couldn't
                    due to my workload. I eventually got the chance and I
                    decided to create my own application, which would be always
                    be open source and devoid of pesky ads and trial time
                    limitations, and thus Kommadek was born.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I used C++ for building Kommadek, and for GUI design and
                    development, I used the Qt framework because Qt is a cross
                    platform framework, so my application would be supported on
                    multiple platforms and since I have prior work experience
                    working with Qt, so I am quite comfortable with Qt, to the
                    point that I enjoy creating applications with Qt.

                    Open Source Notepad Clone is a GUI (Graphical User
                    Interface) application for reading text based files. It is a
                    cross-platform application and can be used in macOS, Windows

                    It also allows the user to adjust the opacity of the
                    application via a slider. The reason I implemented this
                    functionality was because while learning a new language, I
                    do not prefer to copy and paste code snippets from the
                    book/website I am learning from, as advised by a wise
                    programmer I know. Instead I prefer to write down the
                    complete syntax myself. As I did not have an extra monitor
                    at the time I created this project, and because I found
                    switching between windows particularly annoying, I decided
                    to add an opacity slider which would allow the user to
                    change the opacity of the editor to a level where text can
                    be entered while looking at the code present in the
                    book/website behind the editor.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Just like for Kommadek, I used C++ for building Open Source
                    Notepad Clone, and for GUI design and development, I used
                    the Qt framework.

                    Open Source Notepad Clone has not been hosted on any
                    repository hosting service, but if I do host it later, I
                    will add the link here.
