            <p>
              Hi! I am a graduate student at Portland State University. I worked
              as a software engineer for four years before starting my Master of
              Science program in Computer Science. I primarily worked in the
              development of Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality applications.
            </p>
            <p>
              My area of specialisation was creating User Interface for the
              VR/AR apps and my tech stack was initially C++ with Qt and Open
              Scene Graph (based on OpenGL), and later Unreal Engine.
            </p>
            <p>
              I am also very interested in web development, especially UI and
              frontend development. Apart from that, I am also interested in
              learning about Vulkan, which is a graphics API by Khronos Group,
              and Metal, which is a graphics API by Apple.
            </p>
            <p>
              My hobbies are traveling, riding motorcycles, reading novels and
              watching YouTube.

                    Kommadek is a GUI (Graphical User Interface) application for
                    reading CSV (Comma Separated Values) files. It allows the
                    user to select a CSV file from the local file system and
                    then display it in a tabular format. It also allows the user
                    to edit the contents of the CSV file and either overwrite
                    the changes or save it as a separate file. It is a
                    cross-platform application and can be used in macOS, Windows
                    and Linux.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The primary reason for building the project was that I was
                    looking for a clean and minimal CSV reader which could
                    display the contents of a CSV file in a tabular format when
                    I was working in my previous company where I often had to
                    work with CSV files in the project I was assigned to. Many
                    such applications were available, but unfortunately most of
                    them were shareware or adware or freemium software. I wanted
                    at least a freeware application, if not open source.
                    Unfortunately I could not find any such application for
                    macOS so I wanted to make one myself instead, but I couldn't
                    due to my workload. I eventually got the chance and I
                    decided to create my own application, which would be always
                    be open source and devoid of pesky ads and trial time
                    limitations, and thus Kommadek was born.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I used C++ for building Kommadek, and for GUI design and
                    development, I used the Qt framework because Qt is a cross
                    platform framework, so my application would be supported on
                    multiple platforms and since I have prior work experience
                    working with Qt and I enjoy working in Qt.

                    Alpha is a GUI (Graphical User Interface) application for
                    reading text based files. It is a cross-platform application
                    and can be used in macOS, Windows and Linux.

                    It also allows the user to adjust the opacity of the
                    application via a slider. The reason I implemented this
                    functionality was because while learning a new language, I
                    do not prefer to copy and paste code snippets from the
                    book/website I am learning from, as advised by a wise
                    programmer I know. Instead I prefer to write down the
                    complete syntax myself. As I did not have an extra monitor
                    at the time I created this project, and because I found
                    switching between windows particularly annoying, I decided
                    to add an opacity slider which would allow the user to
                    change the opacity of the editor to a level where text can
                    be entered while looking at the code present in the
                    book/website behind the editor.

                  <p>
                    Just like for Kommadek, I used C++ for building Alpha, and
                    for GUI design and development, I used the Qt framework.
